Personal Projects Done in R

This script is meant to mimic the df.profile_report() function from the pandas_profiling package in python. 

The function will report the following for all variables:<br/>
  -Missingness<br/>
  -Mean / median / variation
  -Potential outliers
  -Percent of unique values
  -Percent of values equal to 0
  -Histogram of variable distributions
  
In the future, a correlation report will also be added.
